## Running about the place

Since moving to Edinburgh I have done many really enjoyable runs, although I miss the peak district and am not a fan of running in the city a huge landscape of new places to go have opened up to me and it's brilliant.

Below are photo's from some of my most memorable days.

View down the beautiful range of hills to the West of Edinburgh, the Pentlands. The majority of my runs are in this range and they are just excellent for hill running, being grassy, steep in places and very accessible.

We managed to get over to Arran a few months after we arrived. Less than two hours to get to the ferry port from Edinburgh. It rained most of the time but it didn't matter, we loved it. I managed a raid on Goatfell too in between showers, although the views were a bit limited!

Pretty much the high point of an attempt to run up Ben Ledi during a family visit to Strathyre - snow beat me back and this was before even the "beast from the east" had arrived...

A more successful day trip from Edinburgh up Ben Venue before christmas, got up early drove down and was back by mid afternoon. Perfect!

Ffin looking out over Edinburgh from Caerketton Hill, one of the most Easterly tops of the Pentlands. I love this city!
