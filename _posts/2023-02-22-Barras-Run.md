## A new route for me

Out along the scenic driveway and onto the steep road leading towards Tan hill. I took a turn right onto a bridleway which I have rarely run on and followed an old footpath which would lead around MIddle Fell and onto the road again. The weather was drizzle and light was getting dim as it was an hour or so before sunset.

The path had rarely been used and it took a bit of wall following to find a gate. A sturdily built thing which was holding together nicely despite being mostly rust. I followed the wall through the next field as didn't want to find myself in bogland, in the mist, running in circles.

Back on the road I decided I would try the cross moor route to the transmitter on Moudy Mea (Moudy is scots for Mole don't you know). I knew this would be rough ground but again followed the wall and found it to be just about runnable and only a little boggy. Around half way there was a substantial sheep fold ruin, which may have had a barn attached once?

Once at the transmitter I jogged back and enjoyed the fact I had achey legs from a couple of days in a row running. I hopped over the bridge wall to access the top of Mousegill Beck and followed the edge round back to the farm. A truly spectacular place even on a misty day.

The day before I had climbed up through the gorge on an entirely dry river bed, as the water had mostly found a way through the limestone in a more direct route under ground. However as it had been raining it was no longer dry so would have been a bit too "sporting" to descend.
