The pomodoro technique is a method for both avoiding procrastination and preventing mental performance degradation over time. As a master procrastinator I find it really helps for forcing me to get down to work, when all the distracting delights of the internet are present. The name means "tomato" in Italian, and relates to the kitchen timers shaped like a tomato, which make sure that you cook your tomatoes for over 25 minutes (any less equals BAD tomato sauce and you wouldn't want that, WOULD YOU?)

## This is how you Pomodoro:

Set a task which you would like to complete, try to stick to a reasonable size. 

Find a timer of some sort, which will count down from 20 or 25 minutes.

Start the timer and work for 25 minutes, without allowing any distractions to filter in.

After the time is up take a four minute break. During this time try to relax and break your attention from the task. I like to rest my eyes, looking anywhere but the monitor and do some stretching.

Start the next pomodoro session. After 4 pomodoro's take a longer break. Perhaps a game of table tennis or catch up on the last two hours social media, which you have done so well to ignore for TWO HOURS!

## Tips:

There are many apps/webpages available, which act as pomodoro timers. However the disadvantage to these is that they live on the device of infinite distractions. I like to use an actual wind up kitchen timer instead.

Handling distractions can make this pretty difficult to do in the office, unless you manage to terrify your coworkers into not speaking to you while the timer is ticking. I find it best for working at home where I can manage the distraction and ignoring people/emails won't piss everyone off/get me fired.
